# Introduction:
Hello. I am Svyatoslav Rogozin, the creator of this repository. 
The repository visualizes raw data from two forest stations in Estonia: Agali II and Soontaga. 
Whole HTML page was created using R Markdown and the flexdashboard package.
The visualization of raw data was performed in R using the scattermore library.
The "calculated data" were estimated using the RFlux package in R.
Interactive plots were created using Plotly within R Markdown, with Python code integrated. 
The HTML page hosting these plots is made through GitHub Pages.

Everything is 100% automated.

[Enjoy it.](https://svyatoslav-stack.github.io/Stations/)
