# Introduction:
Hello. I am Svyatoslav Rogozin, the creator of this repository. 
The repository visualizes raw data from two forest stations in Estonia: Agali II and Soontaga. 
This HTML page was created using the Python core of Jupyter Notebook. 
However, the visualization of raw data and the EddyPro Express mode calculations (RFlux package) were performed in R. 
Interactive plots were created using Plotly in Jupyter Notebook. 
HTML page is hosted by GitHub Pages.
[Enjoy it.](https://svyatoslav-stack.github.io/Stations/)
